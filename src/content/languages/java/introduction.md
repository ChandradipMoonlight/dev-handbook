# Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. It's designed to be platform-independent, meaning you can write code once and run it anywhere.

## Why Learn Java?

Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, used by millions of developers. Here are some key reasons to learn Java:

- **Platform Independence**: Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- **Object-Oriented**: Java follows OOP principles, making code organized and reusable
- **Large Community**: Extensive support and resources available
- **Wide Usage**: Used in web applications, mobile apps (Android), enterprise software, and more

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Hello World Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

This is the classic first program. The `main` method is the entry point of any Java application.

### Example 2: Simple Calculator

```java
public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 5;
        
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + (a / b));
    }
}
```

## Key Concepts

- **Classes**: Java programs are organized into classes
- **Methods**: Functions that perform specific tasks
- **Variables**: Store data values
- **JVM**: Java Virtual Machine that executes Java bytecode

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, you can move on to learning about:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Collections and data structures
